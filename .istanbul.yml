The `watermarks` section does not have a command line equivalent. It allows
you to set up low and high watermark percentages for reporting. These are
honored by all reporters that colorize their output based on low/ medium/ high
coverage.

The `reportConfig` section allows you to configure each report format
independently and has no command-line equivalent either.

The `check` section configures minimum threshold enforcement for coverage
results. `global` applies to all files together and `each` on a per-file
basis. A list of files can be excluded from enforcement relative to root via
the `exclude` property.
